This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
options(digits=3, scipen=999)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```
```{r}
positive_data <- read.csv("~/Downloads/Crash_and_Road_and_Weather_Cleaned.csv")
negative_data <- read.csv("~/Downloads/Crash_and_Road_and_Weather_Added.csv")
```

```{r}
str(negative_data)
```

```{r}
negative_select <- negative_data %>% 
  mutate(
    new_date = CRASH.TIME,
    CRASH.TIME = CRASH.DATE,
    CRASH.DATE = new_date
    ) %>% select(
      CRASH.DATE,
      CRASH.TIME,
      LATITUDE,
      LONGITUDE,
      temp,
      dwpt,
      rhum,
      prcp,
      wdir,
      wspd,
      pres,
      coco
    )
```

```{r}
positive_select <- positive_data %>% 
  select(
    CRASH.DATE,
      CRASH.TIME,
      LATITUDE,
      LONGITUDE,
      temp,
      dwpt,
      rhum,
      prcp,
      wdir,
      wspd,
      pres,
      coco
  )
```
```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
